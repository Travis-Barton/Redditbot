# Redditbot

This is my repository for running my redditbot, which is for reading in titles of new posts in the subreddit ['askscience'](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/) and attempting to predict their title.

The file redditbot2.0.py is the main file and will perform the actual running of the bot.
The file Feed_Network_Maker.py holds many of the key functions for treating the data. (This includes the feed reduction technique described in Redditbot_Paper.pdf) and is my more general file for experimenting with the functions. 
The other files are for testing, model efficiency, or managing information requests on my subreddit [r/travsbots](https://old.reddit.com/r/travsbots/), and will thus only be helpful for me.

If you have any questions on how to run this code, please post on the subreddit before emailing me so that people with similar questions can find their answers. If you would rather not, however, feel free to email me at travisdatabarton@gmail.com with [Redditbot] in the subject line.
