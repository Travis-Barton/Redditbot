We developed a simulation model, called NarcoLogic, that found the result of the 'cat-and-mouse' game of narco-trafficking and counterdrug interdiction strategies is a larger geographic area for trafficking with little success in stopping the drug from reaching the United States. In reality, narco-traffickers respond to interdiction by adpating their routes and modes of transit, adjusting their networks to exploit new locations. The space drug traffickers use, known as the 'transit zone', has spread from roughly 2 million square miles in 1996 to 7 million square miles in 2017. As a result, efforts by the United States to curtail illegal narcotics from getting into the country by smuggling routes through Central America over the past decades have been costly and ineffective.

So as the aperture is shrunk down, do the two relationships describe different things? For example, does the NA associated with the aperture of the laser beam describe how small of a *Gaussian* spot can be formed, and the NA associated with the lens itself describe the size of the airy disk that all the light coming through the aperture can be condensed into?

I guess fundamentally it's just confusing because a coherent beam is usually implied to only have a NA related to the beam diameter, but after passing through an aperture it diffracts so the whole diameter of the lens is relevant in picking up and focusing the higher diffraction orders.

2752,,beeso8,Does instantaneous wavefunction collapse imply an infinite derivative?,physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-17,"Hello, I am an engineering student taking a quantum computing class. Getting straight to the question, my professor said that when a measurement is made of a particle the wavefunction instantaneously collapses into a Dirac delta at the measurement of interest and zero elsewhere. Coming from a signals background, this is counterfactual to everything I have been taught. Firstly, a Dirac delta should not be a physical phenomenon; the signals analogue is an impulse, which cannot be physically realizable as it would require an infinite derivative. Secondly, the idea that a continuous distribution (the squared wavefunction) instantaneously shifting to anything would imply a time derivative of infinity, which again should be physically impossible.

The only solution that I can imagine is that the wavefunction actually converges extremely rapidly (but not infinitely) as the particle ""approaches measurement"" (i.e., as it approaches interaction with another particle), but this is 100% intuitive conjecture and in no way backed by theory. Am I incorrect about the impossibility of physical infinite derivatives, or is there a more subtle interpretation afoot?"

One individual with bad breath decides to start taking garlic supplements anyways, even though he fully understands that it will not improve his bad breath. However, the day after he starts taking the garlic supplements, he notices his bad breath is completely gone. He also notices that if he forgets to take garlic one day, his bad breath comes back. He knows with 100% certainty that he did not make any other changes besides the garlic.

In this scenario, garlic has been “proven” to not cure bad breath, but how could scientists say with confidence that this individual’s bad breath improved due to the placebo effect instead of some other cause that could have caused the garlic to actually work for him (like maybe he has slightly different stomach acid than 99.8% of the population that was causing his bad breath, and the garlic neutralized it but no one thought to test for that because it’s super random)? 


Basically, if something is considered to be a placebo treatment, that means that it didn’t show consistent/measurable improvement when studied in a clinical trial, right? But if a placebo appears to work for patients sporadically or inconsistently, is it really more likely that it’s just the placebo effect, as opposed to the ‘treatment’ actually working in specific situations/ways that weren’t just weren’t shown in the population studied? 

TLDR: is the placebo effect, specifically in people who know they’re taking a placebo, basically just a fancy way of saying “this treatment shouldn’t work and we don’t know any legitimate mechanisms for how it could work, so we’re going to say it’s just the placebo effect even though we don’t know the true root cause of why the patient’s condition improved”?"

 I'm trying to clarify how the algorithm was tested, as it's explained in [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_bouman_what_does_a_black_hole_look_like?fbclid=IwAR0yCj29a1fC6rPHSAAVm9p1Hh3jfZQ6Jmbg1PyqNLzX_rSbgcMx7TEfNGQ#t-524588) video from around 8:38 - 11:47. My question is: If the purpose of the tests is to ensure that the software generates a composite image of what exists, rather than simply reiterating we expect to see, then how exactly would a software that takes in any set of data, and returns a similar end result (regardless of if the images are black holes, planets, stars, or facebook photos) prove that the algorithm is functioning correctly?

Say there are 100 boxes. Contestant 1 picks box 35. There's obviously a 1/100 chance of him being right. The host opens 98 of the other boxes, and they're all empty. At this point, even though there are only two boxes, there's still a 1/100 chance that box 35 is the right one, meaning there's a 99/100 chance the remaining box is the right one. I get that much.

What I don't get is what happens if a new player joins the game at this point. This new player has no idea what is going on, and just sees two boxes. He's told to pick one, and picks 35 too. Does he not have a 1/2 chance of being right?

2765,,bekgtj,"What is the state of a particle that has collapsed its wavefunction to one observer, but not another?",physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-18,"Possibly, I may be thinking of a problem already addressed by quantum entanglement, but my idea was more me thinking about how an instantaneous collapse of a particle's wavefunction works with special relativity. I'm aware that the information that the wavefunction has collapsed cannot reach a distant observer faster than the speed of light. However, what I do not understand is that if the wavefunction is distributed throughout all of spacetime, how a complete and instantaneous collapse would apply to all of spacetime in that instant, such as to a distant observer. I understand that special relativity postulates that all inertial reference frames much agree, but am unsure as to how this resolves the observations of observers positioned at different points in space."

I believe that when things are more spread out, it take more effort to rotate it.  Like spinning around with your arms in or extended out.  There’s more resistance when out.   I assume that’s why ice skaters that spin do so with their arms in - to spin faster.

As described, the void formed of smaller voids and have combined to make a larger void. Similar to the way that bubbles coalesce to form a larger bubble. But how is this analogy apt? Bubbles have a force pushing out on their boundaries which give them shape and allow for this expansion when another bubble joins with it. How would we describe this in the sense of a void?

But what about reflection? Is there a fully quantum treatment of reflection available yet? Like, not with two or three state systems absorbing and emitting a photon or two, but real world scenario, like we have for refraction? My question comes from examining the Shot Noise Limit and the Standard Quantum Limit in the Interferometer. We know where and how the photon count error and the radiation pressure error enter the evolution of light in the arms of the interferometer, but we don't really know how the mass position error enters it. The reason why we haven't been able to do anything about it mainly is because we don't have a quantum treatment of reflection, even in microscopic interferometers where the mirrors can be treated as quantum objects, as far as I know."

We're here to answer your questions about controlling emotions at work, its effects on health and productivity, or what the heck an industrial/organizational psychologist is, anyway.

First, some basics. Industrial/Organizational psychology is the scientific study of people at work. Topics range from how to fairly select and place the best applicants, evaluate training programs, and measure job performance; to how to lead effectively, work in teams, motivate employees, and improve their health. It also just so happens to be one of the best jobs in science, according to [U.S. News and World Report](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-science-jobs) (not that we're bragging or anything...).

Our line of research, which focuses on emotional labor, ties in aspects of employee motivation, performance, and health. Similar to how we think of jobs requiring physical or mental labor, emotional labor refers to controlling your emotions to be in line with how your job expects you to feel - like how restaurant servers, nurses, cashiers, teachers, bartenders are expected to be kind, friendly, or service-oriented. We typically talk about emotional labor being done through two strategies:

+ **Surface acting** - faking or suppressing your emotional display to others
 + Faking a smile, holding back frustration towards a customer
+ **Deep acting** - bringing your true feelings in line with what the job requires
 + Thinking happy thoughts before a shift

There's been a ton of work looking at the effects of emotional labor since Arlie Hochschild
coined the concept in [1983](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520272941/the-managed-heart) - here's a [basic summary](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721418812771), as well as a more [in-depth review](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-04571-001).

In a national sample of U.S. workers, [our study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-11105-001) finds that *individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking*. This relationship holds even after accounting for demographics (gender, age, education, income), employees' tendency to be in a bad mood, and the emotional demands of the job. We also found that employees who are more impulsive, have less control over their work, or have more short-term interactions (think cashier, compared to nurse or teacher) are especially at risk. We'll be on from 2-4 (ET, 18-20 UT) and we'd love to answer any questions you might have about our study, emotional labor more generally, or the study of people at work!

This made sense to me overall, but of course I intuitively believed that since solids are more orderly, you could find discrete axes and planes to perform transformation that would ideally return everything back to where it started.

2970,,bgiyfb,How is the CNOT gate in quantum teleportation allowed to break entanglement?,physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-23,"Perhaps the title is confusingly worded, but I can't think of a better way.

In today's quantum computing class, we discussed quantum teleportation. Specifically, we discussed the following scenario:

* Alice possesses a particle in the state |Psi> = a|0> + B|1>

* Both Alice and Bob receive one of a pair of entangle particles, both of which exist in the Bell state |B_00> = 1/sqrt2 * (|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>

* Alice passes her particles through a CNOT gate, |Psi_a> = W_CNOT(|Psi>|B_A>) (where |B_A> is Alice's part of the entangled pair)

* Alice then passes her |Psi> particle through a Hadamard gate.

* The final state of the composite system is then a superposition with equal probability of Alice measuring her pair of particles in any combination, and Bob's particle is a superposition matching Alice's |Psi> particle.

(Side note, this would be much clearer if the subreddit supported LaTeX.)

What I don't understand is how passing Alice's part of the entangled Bell pair can change Alice's particle but not Bob's particle. Isn't the CNOT gate interacting with (i.e. measuring) Alice's particle, and therefore collapsing Bob's particle? Specifically (ignoring constants),

|Psi_sys> = |Psi>|B_00>

|Psi_sys> = (|0> + |1>)(|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = |0>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |1>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |0>(|1_A>|1_B>) + |1>(|1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = (|0>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|1>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|0>|1_A>)|1_B> + (|1>|1_A>)|1_B>

This last step feels like abuse of notation, considering the entangled nature of the Bell state. Can someone clarify what is happening here?"
