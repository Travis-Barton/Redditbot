We developed a simulation model, called NarcoLogic, that found the result of the 'cat-and-mouse' game of narco-trafficking and counterdrug interdiction strategies is a larger geographic area for trafficking with little success in stopping the drug from reaching the United States. In reality, narco-traffickers respond to interdiction by adpating their routes and modes of transit, adjusting their networks to exploit new locations. The space drug traffickers use, known as the 'transit zone', has spread from roughly 2 million square miles in 1996 to 7 million square miles in 2017. As a result, efforts by the United States to curtail illegal narcotics from getting into the country by smuggling routes through Central America over the past decades have been costly and ineffective.

So as the aperture is shrunk down, do the two relationships describe different things?

I guess fundamentally it's just confusing because a coherent beam is usually implied to only have a NA related to the beam diameter, but after passing through an aperture it diffracts so the whole diameter of the lens is relevant in picking up and focusing the higher diffraction orders.

2752,beeso8,Does instantaneous wavefunction collapse imply an infinite derivative?,physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-17,"Hello, I am an engineering student taking a quantum computing class. Getting straight to the question, my professor said that when a measurement is made of a particle the wavefunction instantaneously collapses into a Dirac delta at the measurement of interest and zero elsewhere. Coming from a signals background, this is counterfactual to everything I have been taught. Firstly, a Dirac delta should not be a physical phenomenon; the signals analogue is an impulse, which cannot be physically realizable as it would require an infinite derivative. Secondly, the idea that a continuous distribution (the squared wavefunction) instantaneously shifting to anything would imply a time derivative of infinity, which again should be physically impossible.

The only solution that I can imagine is that the wavefunction actually converges extremely rapidly (but not infinitely) as the particle ""approaches measurement"" (i.e., as it approaches interaction with another particle), but this is 100% intuitive conjecture and in no way backed by theory.

One individual with bad breath decides to start taking garlic supplements anyways, even though he fully understands that it will not improve his bad breath. However, the day after he starts taking the garlic supplements, he notices his bad breath is completely gone. He also notices that if he forgets to take garlic one day, his bad breath comes back. He knows with 100% certainty that he did not make any other changes besides the garlic.

In this scenario, garlic has been “proven” to not cure bad breath, but how could scientists say with confidence that this individual’s bad breath improved due to the placebo effect instead of some other cause that could have caused the garlic to actually work for him (like maybe he has slightly different stomach acid than 99.8% of the population that was causing his bad breath, and the garlic neutralized it but no one thought to test for that because it’s super random)? 


Basically, if something is considered to be a placebo treatment, that means that it didn’t show consistent/measurable improvement when studied in a clinical trial, right?

TLDR: is the placebo effect, specifically in people who know they’re taking a placebo, basically just a fancy way of saying “this treatment shouldn’t work and we don’t know any legitimate mechanisms for how it could work, so we’re going to say it’s just the placebo effect even though we don’t know the true root cause of why the patient’s condition improved”?"

 I'm trying to clarify how the algorithm was tested, as it's explained in [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_bouman_what_does_a_black_hole_look_like?fbclid=IwAR0yCj29a1fC6rPHSAAVm9p1Hh3jfZQ6Jmbg1PyqNLzX_rSbgcMx7TEfNGQ#t-524588) video from around 8:38 - 11:47. My question is: If the purpose of the tests is to ensure that the software generates a composite image of what exists, rather than simply reiterating we expect to see, then how exactly would a software that takes in any set of data, and returns a similar end result (regardless of if the images are black holes, planets, stars, or facebook photos) prove that the algorithm is functioning correctly?

Say there are 100 boxes. Contestant 1 picks box 35. There's obviously a 1/100 chance of him being right. The host opens 98 of the other boxes, and they're all empty. At this point, even though there are only two boxes, there's still a 1/100 chance that box 35 is the right one, meaning there's a 99/100 chance the remaining box is the right one. I get that much.

What I don't get is what happens if a new player joins the game at this point. This new player has no idea what is going on, and just sees two boxes. He's told to pick one, and picks 35 too. Does he not have a 1/2 chance of being right?

If so, that means that player one has a 1/100 chance of being right while player two has a 1/2 chance, despite at this point having the same number of options and picking the same door.

2765,bekgtj,"What is the state of a particle that has collapsed its wavefunction to one observer, but not another?",physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-18,"Possibly, I may be thinking of a problem already addressed by quantum entanglement, but my idea was more me thinking about how an instantaneous collapse of a particle's wavefunction works with special relativity. I'm aware that the information that the wavefunction has collapsed cannot reach a distant observer faster than the speed of light. However, what I do not understand is that if the wavefunction is distributed throughout all of spacetime, how a complete and instantaneous collapse would apply to all of spacetime in that instant, such as to a distant observer. I understand that special relativity postulates that all inertial reference frames much agree, but am unsure as to how this resolves the observations of observers positioned at different points in space."

I believe that when things are more spread out, it take more effort to rotate it.  Like spinning around with your arms in or extended out.  There’s more resistance when out.   I assume that’s why ice skaters that spin do so with their arms in - to spin faster.

They use entangled photons to probe protein concentration, studies based on refractive index, but that only deals with phase accumulated, afaik, and there's no huge need for a hamiltonian for that, it can be done with what we know classically. But what about reflection? Is there a fully quantum treatment of reflection available yet? Like, not with two or three state systems absorbing and emitting a photon or two, but real world scenario, like we have for refraction? My question comes from examining the Shot Noise Limit and the Standard Quantum Limit in the Interferometer. We know where and how the photon count error and the radiation pressure error enter the evolution of light in the arms of the interferometer, but we don't really know how the mass position error enters it. The reason why we haven't been able to do anything about it mainly is because we don't have a quantum treatment of reflection, even in microscopic interferometers where the mirrors can be treated as quantum objects, as far as I know."

Multiplying becomes an expensive thing to do, and this gets, a lot, worse if the numbers used are, very, big. A big number, in this case, are the amount of digits used before and, if relevant, after the decimal dot (using English notation, this would be the comma in Europe).

We're here to answer your questions about controlling emotions at work, its effects on health and productivity, or what the heck an industrial/organizational psychologist is, anyway.

First, some basics. Industrial/Organizational psychology is the scientific study of people at work. Topics range from how to fairly select and place the best applicants, evaluate training programs, and measure job performance; to how to lead effectively, work in teams, motivate employees, and improve their health. It also just so happens to be one of the best jobs in science, according to [U.S. News and World Report](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-science-jobs) (not that we're bragging or anything...).

Our line of research, which focuses on emotional labor, ties in aspects of employee motivation, performance, and health. Similar to how we think of jobs requiring physical or mental labor, emotional labor refers to controlling your emotions to be in line with how your job expects you to feel - like how restaurant servers, nurses, cashiers, teachers, bartenders are expected to be kind, friendly, or service-oriented. We typically talk about emotional labor being done through two strategies:

+ **Surface acting** - faking or suppressing your emotional display to others
 + Faking a smile, holding back frustration towards a customer
+ **Deep acting** - bringing your true feelings in line with what the job requires
 + Thinking happy thoughts before a shift

There's been a ton of work looking at the effects of emotional labor since Arlie Hochschild
coined the concept in [1983](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520272941/the-managed-heart) - here's a [basic summary](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721418812771), as well as a more [in-depth review](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-04571-001).

In a national sample of U.S. workers, [our study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-11105-001) finds that *individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking*. This relationship holds even after accounting for demographics (gender, age, education, income), employees' tendency to be in a bad mood, and the emotional demands of the job. We also found that employees who are more impulsive, have less control over their work, or have more short-term interactions (think cashier, compared to nurse or teacher) are especially at risk. We'll be on from 2-4 (ET, 18-20 UT) and we'd love to answer any questions you might have about our study, emotional labor more generally, or the study of people at work!

This made sense to me overall, but of course I intuitively believed that since solids are more orderly, you could find discrete axes and planes to perform transformation that would ideally return everything back to where it started.

In today's quantum computing class, we discussed quantum teleportation. Specifically, we discussed the following scenario:

* Alice possesses a particle in the state |Psi> = a|0> + B|1>

* Both Alice and Bob receive one of a pair of entangle particles, both of which exist in the Bell state |B_00> = 1/sqrt2 * (|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>

* Alice passes her particles through a CNOT gate, |Psi_a> = W_CNOT(|Psi>|B_A>) (where |B_A> is Alice's part of the entangled pair)

* Alice then passes her |Psi> particle through a Hadamard gate.

* The final state of the composite system is then a superposition with equal probability of Alice measuring her pair of particles in any combination, and Bob's particle is a superposition matching Alice's |Psi> particle.

(Side note, this would be much clearer if the subreddit supported LaTeX.)

What I don't understand is how passing Alice's part of the entangled Bell pair can change Alice's particle but not Bob's particle. Isn't the CNOT gate interacting with (i.e. measuring) Alice's particle, and therefore collapsing Bob's particle? Specifically (ignoring constants),

|Psi_sys> = |Psi>|B_00>

|Psi_sys> = (|0> + |1>)(|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = |0>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |1>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |0>(|1_A>|1_B>) + |1>(|1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = (|0>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|1>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|0>|1_A>)|1_B> + (|1>|1_A>)|1_B>

This last step feels like abuse of notation, considering the entangled nature of the Bell state. Can someone clarify what is happening here?"

This is odd because Jupiter, for example, has 79 Moons and it’s made of gas and therefore has no possibility of forming a moon via collision like earth did. 

Ive done a bit of research and I am a little confused at what I’ve found. So I understand that Jupiter’s outer moons orbit the opposite way of Jupiter’s rotation thus pointing to the idea that the  outer moons are asteroids that got caught into an orbit. This seems plausible.
However, the inner moons are supposedly formed during the gaseous phase of our Solar System!? 

This doesn’t make sense to me because why would the primordial stew of gasses be attracted to random smaller collections around Juipiter instead of into the single massive collection of gas’s forming near it (Jupiter). This also brings up another question! How did all these planets and moons initially get their tangential velocity to maintain orbits when they were first formed from gasses? I’m very confused :/"

2995,bfo6m4,[Mathematics] Is there a faster way to multiply (large) numbers?,other,maths,0.0,2019-04-24,"The question should be clear enough, but just to make sure:

I think we all learned to multiply in the following way: put one number below the other, multiply each digit from the bottom row with each digit from the top row, add the results together and you have the solution:
 
       12
     * 34
    -----
        8  4*2                  8
       4   4*1 -> 4*10   -> +  40
       6   3*2 -> 30*2   -> +  60
      3    3*1 -> 30*10  -> + 300
                            -----
                              408

This is straightforward, easy and adequate, especially for daily use. Most steps are done automatically after a while such as carrying/adding the digit(s). But.....

Multiplying becomes an expensive thing to do, and this gets, a lot, worse if the numbers used are, very, big. A big number, in this case, are the amount of digits used before and, if relevant, after the decimal dot (using English notation, this would be the comma in Europe).

> Two one digit numbers need 1 step (not expensive at all),

> A 4 and a 5 digit number needs 39 steps,

> A 11 and 14 digit number needs 307 steps.


Formula I use: *no_digits_1 * no_digits_2 + (no_digits_1 * no_digits_2 - 1)*

I am aware that if a faster way of multiplying does exist, this wouldn't necessarily also be a better way for daily use. I'm just really curious if a way exists at all.

My question is this: say you measure only *one* of the two slits. Then, when the particles is sent out, it goes through the slit you are not measuring. Since you know it *didn’t* go through the slit you *are* measuring, that also should exhibit the observer effect, right? But this is insane, because your measurement never actually interacts with or observes the particle. It just observes somewhere that it *isn’t*.

So I guess I’m asking if this is actually what would happen, or if it would still exhibit an interference pattern somehow. And importantly, *why*, because this whole thing seems crazy to me."

We study the environmental effects of marine energy at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Ask us anything!",geo,geo,1.0,2019-04-24,"Hi Reddit!! Marine energy is a huge, largely untapped energy resource. So huge that more than 10% of Pacific states' electricity demand could be satisfied by developing a fraction of the wave energy available off the West coast.

Imagine a future where we could harness ALL of our oceans' energy, including energy from moving water, like waves, currents, tides, and offshore winds. Renewable energy like this is not only immense, but its predictable nature allows power grid managers to offset more established, yet variable renewable resources such as wind and solar power. And on a regional scale, widespread marine energy has the potential to provide localized power sources in isolated coastal regions and areas susceptible to extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and storm surge.

But are there environmental costs to widespread installation of marine energy devices in our oceans? How does marine life react to these devices? And is this approach safe?

At the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we are tackling these exact research questions [here](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/The%20State%20of%20Knowledge%20Driving%20Consenting%20Permiting%20for%20the%20MRE.pdf). Ask us Anything!

And that this energy which is released is often equivalent to the mass energy of a few solar masses at least, in the case of the merger first detected by LIGO. As I understand, nothing can escape from within the Event Horizon of a black hole but somehow something must get out because there is energy released when two black holes merge together.  

My question is, how can energy be released by to merging black holes? Is this some form of Hawking radiation? What is the mechanism that allows for this release of energy?

Bonus Q: how is it that merging black holes which are orbiting each other can have their orbits decay? I would expect, since the mass inside is a singularity, that tidal forces, which are usually the mechanism for bleeding off orbital energy, wouldn't really make sense between two point masses."

I noticed that when you look at the universe as a whole on that picture, you can see a pattern of very irregular shaped circles, where the stars/brightness are most concentrated on the outlines of each blobby circle. It's like in a way, our whole universe looks like a blobby 3D array of the inside of a beehive.

This got me thinking, does that mean that the overall concentration of each element of matter is *roughly* spread uniformly throughout the universe? And when looking at our own solar system, does it make mathematical sense where the planets in our own solar system formed relative to the distance of their orbital paths around the sun, and the concentration of elements that formed each planet?

**Main question that clarifies what I am asking in the title** Has it been observed in other solar systems with suns similar in size/mass to our own, that planets made mostly of certain elements would form in certain ranges of distances from their own suns similar to our own solar system? Like if you zoomed in on a random solar system with a similar sized sun, we'd see a planet roughly the same distance from its sun as Mars, and it would be very similar to our own Mars, and same with planets that are located the same distance from their sun as our own Earth, Mercury, Jupiter, and so on?"

3051,bgf0is,"AskScience AMA Series: We're the researchers behind the ""faking a smile"" and drinking study, ask us anything!",other,psych,0.0,2019-04-24,"We're industrial/organizational psychologists whose recent study on emotional labor and drinking gained [some traction on /r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bbe8ir/employees_who_force_themselves_to_smile_and_be/). We're here to answer your questions about controlling emotions at work, its effects on health and productivity, or what the heck an industrial/organizational psychologist is, anyway.

First, some basics. Industrial/Organizational psychology is the scientific study of people at work. Topics range from how to fairly select and place the best applicants, evaluate training programs, and measure job performance; to how to lead effectively, work in teams, motivate employees, and improve their health. It also just so happens to be one of the best jobs in science, according to [U.S. News and World Report](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-science-jobs) (not that we're bragging or anything...).

Our line of research, which focuses on emotional labor, ties in aspects of employee motivation, performance, and health. Similar to how we think of jobs requiring physical or mental labor, emotional labor refers to controlling your emotions to be in line with how your job expects you to feel - like how restaurant servers, nurses, cashiers, teachers, bartenders are expected to be kind, friendly, or service-oriented. We typically talk about emotional labor being done through two strategies:

+ **Surface acting** - faking or suppressing your emotional display to others
 + Faking a smile, holding back frustration towards a customer
+ **Deep acting** - bringing your true feelings in line with what the job requires
 + Thinking happy thoughts before a shift

There's been a ton of work looking at the effects of emotional labor since Arlie Hochschild
coined the concept in [1983](https://books.google.com/books?id=X7rSS1RMvVAC&pg=PA3&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false) - here's a [basic summary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kCMyBcVTNxGT3x9PGeu8eZkbihujSqdR), as well as a more [in-depth review](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d7uUUV2WHMZt6dFwFlsFJ3ihW1j-Yb9O).

In a national sample of U.S. workers, [our study](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O2HB_ecOLQqsQ4PjJDXECQrC3ubRcFuQ) finds that *individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking*. This relationship holds even after accounting for demographics (gender, age, education, income), employees' tendency to be in a bad mood, and the emotional demands of the job. We also found that employees who are more impulsive, have less control over their work, or have more short-term interactions (think cashier, compared to nurse or teacher) are especially at risk. We'll be on from 2-4 (ET, 18-20 UT) and we'd love to answer any questions you might have about our study, emotional labor more generally, or the study of people at work!

He was mentioning that it is often understood that liquids and gases are more symmetric than solids because transformations applied don’t seems to alter the macroscopic appearance as much.

This made sense to me overall, but of course I intuitively believed that since solids are more orderly, you could find discrete axes and planes to perform transformation that would ideally return everything back to where it started. The part that doesn’t make sense is the fact that liquids and gases likely wouldn’t microscopically look the same upon performing that same transformation.

Ultimately I’m curious why a break in local symmetry can be “ignored” if a given transformation preserves global symmetry? I’m fairly new to this type of topic so forgive me if this is very basic in the grand scheme."

In today's quantum computing class, we discussed quantum teleportation. Specifically, we discussed the following scenario:

* Alice possesses a particle in the state |Psi> = a|0> + B|1>

* Both Alice and Bob receive one of a pair of entangle particles, both of which exist in the Bell state |B_00> = 1/sqrt2 * (|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>

* Alice passes her particles through a CNOT gate, |Psi_a> = W_CNOT(|Psi>|B_A>) (where |B_A> is Alice's part of the entangled pair)

* Alice then passes her |Psi> particle through a Hadamard gate.

* The final state of the composite system is then a superposition with equal probability of Alice measuring her pair of particles in any combination, and Bob's particle is a superposition matching Alice's |Psi> particle.

(Side note, this would be much clearer if the subreddit supported LaTeX.)

What I don't understand is how passing Alice's part of the entangled Bell pair can change Alice's particle but not Bob's particle. Isn't the CNOT gate interacting with (i.e. measuring) Alice's particle, and therefore collapsing Bob's particle? Specifically (ignoring constants),

|Psi_sys> = |Psi>|B_00>

|Psi_sys> = (|0> + |1>)(|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = |0>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |1>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |0>(|1_A>|1_B>) + |1>(|1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = (|0>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|1>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|0>|1_A>)|1_B> + (|1>|1_A>)|1_B>

This last step feels like abuse of notation, considering the entangled nature of the Bell state. Can someone clarify what is happening here?"

3085,bgqms3,How are Gas Planets’ Moons Formed?,geo,geo,1.0,2019-04-24,"So in my physics class we were discussing Tangential Velocity and orbits and it got me thinking about our moon and how the leading theory involves a large planetary collision with a chunk somehow ending up in orbit.

This is odd because Jupiter, for example, has 79 Moons and it’s made of gas and therefore has no possibility of forming a moon via collision like earth did. 

Ive done a bit of research and I am a little confused at what I’ve found. So I understand that Jupiter’s outer moons orbit the opposite way of Jupiter’s rotation thus pointing to the idea that the  outer moons are asteroids that got caught into an orbit. This seems plausible.
However, the inner moons are supposedly formed during the gaseous phase of our Solar System!? 

This doesn’t make sense to me because why would the primordial stew of gasses be attracted to random smaller collections around Juipiter instead of into the single massive collection of gas’s forming near it (Jupiter). This also brings up another question! How did all these planets and moons initially get their tangential velocity to maintain orbits when they were first formed from gasses? I’m very confused :/"

3095,bfo6m4,[Mathematics] Is there a faster way to multiply (large) numbers?,other,maths,0.0,2019-04-24,"The question should be clear enough, but just to make sure:

I think we all learned to multiply in the following way: put one number below the other, multiply each digit from the bottom row with each digit from the top row, add the results together and you have the solution:
 
       12
     * 34
    -----
        8  4*2                  8
       4   4*1 -> 4*10   -> +  40
       6   3*2 -> 30*2   -> +  60

                              408

This is straightforward, easy and adequate, especially for daily use. Most steps are done automatically after a while such as carrying/adding the digit(s). But.....

Multiplying becomes an expensive thing to do, and this gets, a lot, worse if the numbers used are, very, big. A big number, in this case, are the amount of digits used before and, if relevant, after the decimal dot (using English notation, this would be the comma in Europe).

> Two one digit numbers need 1 step (not expensive at all),

> A 4 and a 5 digit number needs 39 steps,

> A 11 and 14 digit number needs 307 steps.


Formula I use: *no_digits_1 * no_digits_2 + (no_digits_1 * no_digits_2 - 1)*

I am aware that if a faster way of multiplying does exist, this wouldn't necessarily also be a better way for daily use. I'm just really curious if a way exists at all.

Thanks in advance for the answer(s) given!"

My question is this: say you measure only *one* of the two slits. Then, when the particles is sent out, it goes through the slit you are not measuring. Since you know it *didn’t* go through the slit you *are* measuring, that also should exhibit the observer effect, right? But this is insane, because your measurement never actually interacts with or observes the particle. It just observes somewhere that it *isn’t*.

So I guess I’m asking if this is actually what would happen, or if it would still exhibit an interference pattern somehow. And importantly, *why*, because this whole thing seems crazy to me."

Marine energy is a huge, largely untapped energy resource. So huge that more than 10% of Pacific states' electricity demand could be satisfied by developing a fraction of the wave energy available off the West coast.

Imagine a future where we could harness ALL of our oceans' energy, including energy from moving water, like waves, currents, tides, and offshore winds. Renewable energy like this is not only immense, but its predictable nature allows power grid managers to offset more established, yet variable renewable resources such as wind and solar power. And on a regional scale, widespread marine energy has the potential to provide localized power sources in isolated coastal regions and areas susceptible to extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and storm surge.

But are there environmental costs to widespread installation of marine energy devices in our oceans? How does marine life react to these devices? And is this approach safe?

3118,bg27bh,What is the mechanism for energy released by a black hole merger?,physics,astro,0.0,2019-04-24,"I've heard that when two black holes merge there is an incredible amount of energy released. And that this energy which is released is often equivalent to the mass energy of a few solar masses at least, in the case of the merger first detected by LIGO. As I understand, nothing can escape from within the Event Horizon of a black hole but somehow something must get out because there is energy released when two black holes merge together.  

My question is, how can energy be released by to merging black holes? Is this some form of Hawking radiation? What is the mechanism that allows for this release of energy?

Bonus Q: how is it that merging black holes which are orbiting each other can have their orbits decay? I would expect, since the mass inside is a singularity, that tidal forces, which are usually the mechanism for bleeding off orbital energy, wouldn't really make sense between two point masses."

This got me thinking, does that mean that the overall concentration of each element of matter is *roughly* spread uniformly throughout the universe?

My question is this: say you measure only *one* of the two slits. Then, when the particles is sent out, it goes through the slit you are not measuring. Since you know it *didn’t* go through the slit you *are* measuring, that also should exhibit the observer effect, right? But this is insane, because your measurement never actually interacts with or observes the particle. It just observes somewhere that it *isn’t*.

So I guess I’m asking if this is actually what would happen, or if it would still exhibit an interference pattern somehow. And importantly, *why*, because this whole thing seems crazy to me."

Marine energy is a huge, largely untapped energy resource. So huge that more than 10% of Pacific states' electricity demand could be satisfied by developing a fraction of the wave energy available off the West coast.

Imagine a future where we could harness ALL of our oceans' energy, including energy from moving water, like waves, currents, tides, and offshore winds. Renewable energy like this is not only immense, but its predictable nature allows power grid managers to offset more established, yet variable renewable resources such as wind and solar power. And on a regional scale, widespread marine energy has the potential to provide localized power sources in isolated coastal regions and areas susceptible to extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and storm surge.

But are there environmental costs to widespread installation of marine energy devices in our oceans? How does marine life react to these devices? And is this approach safe?

At the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we are tackling these exact research questions [here](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/The%20State%20of%20Knowledge%20Driving%20Consenting%20Permiting%20for%20the%20MRE.pdf). Ask us Anything!

3172,bg27bh,What is the mechanism for energy released by a black hole merger?,physics,astro,0.0,2019-04-24,"I've heard that when two black holes merge there is an incredible amount of energy released. And that this energy which is released is often equivalent to the mass energy of a few solar masses at least, in the case of the merger first detected by LIGO. As I understand, nothing can escape from within the Event Horizon of a black hole but somehow something must get out because there is energy released when two black holes merge together.  

My question is, how can energy be released by to merging black holes? Is this some form of Hawking radiation? What is the mechanism that allows for this release of energy?

Bonus Q: how is it that merging black holes which are orbiting each other can have their orbits decay? I would expect, since the mass inside is a singularity, that tidal forces, which are usually the mechanism for bleeding off orbital energy, wouldn't really make sense between two point masses."

I noticed that when you look at the universe as a whole on that picture, you can see a pattern of very irregular shaped circles, where the stars/brightness are most concentrated on the outlines of each blobby circle. It's like in a way, our whole universe looks like a blobby 3D array of the inside of a beehive.

This got me thinking, does that mean that the overall concentration of each element of matter is *roughly* spread uniformly throughout the universe? And when looking at our own solar system, does it make mathematical sense where the planets in our own solar system formed relative to the distance of their orbital paths around the sun, and the concentration of elements that formed each planet?

**Main question that clarifies what I am asking in the title** Has it been observed in other solar systems with suns similar in size/mass to our own, that planets made mostly of certain elements would form in certain ranges of distances from their own suns similar to our own solar system? Like if you zoomed in on a random solar system with a similar sized sun, we'd see a planet roughly the same distance from its sun as Mars, and it would be very similar to our own Mars, and same with planets that are located the same distance from their sun as our own Earth, Mercury, Jupiter, and so on?"

We're here to answer your questions about controlling emotions at work, its effects on health and productivity, or what the heck an industrial/organizational psychologist is, anyway.

First, some basics. Industrial/Organizational psychology is the scientific study of people at work. Topics range from how to fairly select and place the best applicants, evaluate training programs, and measure job performance; to how to lead effectively, work in teams, motivate employees, and improve their health. It also just so happens to be one of the best jobs in science, according to [U.S. News and World Report](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-science-jobs) (not that we're bragging or anything...).

Our line of research, which focuses on emotional labor, ties in aspects of employee motivation, performance, and health. Similar to how we think of jobs requiring physical or mental labor, emotional labor refers to controlling your emotions to be in line with how your job expects you to feel - like how restaurant servers, nurses, cashiers, teachers, bartenders are expected to be kind, friendly, or service-oriented. We typically talk about emotional labor being done through two strategies:

+ **Surface acting** - faking or suppressing your emotional display to others
 + Faking a smile, holding back frustration towards a customer
+ **Deep acting** - bringing your true feelings in line with what the job requires
 + Thinking happy thoughts before a shift

There's been a ton of work looking at the effects of emotional labor since Arlie Hochschild
coined the concept in [1983](https://books.google.com/books?id=X7rSS1RMvVAC&pg=PA3&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false) - here's a [basic summary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kCMyBcVTNxGT3x9PGeu8eZkbihujSqdR), as well as a more [in-depth review](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d7uUUV2WHMZt6dFwFlsFJ3ihW1j-Yb9O).

In a national sample of U.S. workers, [our study](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O2HB_ecOLQqsQ4PjJDXECQrC3ubRcFuQ) finds that *individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking*. This relationship holds even after accounting for demographics (gender, age, education, income), employees' tendency to be in a bad mood, and the emotional demands of the job. We also found that employees who are more impulsive, have less control over their work, or have more short-term interactions (think cashier, compared to nurse or teacher) are especially at risk. We'll be on from 2-4 (ET, 18-20 UT) and we'd love to answer any questions you might have about our study, emotional labor more generally, or the study of people at work!

3210,bgbe9w,When should you consider global over local symmetry (or vice versa) when it comes to solid or fluid materials?,physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-24,"I was having a discussion with my optics professor about the symmetry of lens and mirror materials at the atomic scale with respect to interactions with light. He was mentioning that it is often understood that liquids and gases are more symmetric than solids because transformations applied don’t seems to alter the macroscopic appearance as much.

This made sense to me overall, but of course I intuitively believed that since solids are more orderly, you could find discrete axes and planes to perform transformation that would ideally return everything back to where it started. The part that doesn’t make sense is the fact that liquids and gases likely wouldn’t microscopically look the same upon performing that same transformation.

Ultimately I’m curious why a break in local symmetry can be “ignored” if a given transformation preserves global symmetry? I’m fairly new to this type of topic so forgive me if this is very basic in the grand scheme."

3227,bgiyfb,How is the CNOT gate in quantum teleportation allowed to break entanglement?,physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-24,"Perhaps the title is confusingly worded, but I can't think of a better way.

In today's quantum computing class, we discussed quantum teleportation. Specifically, we discussed the following scenario:

* Alice possesses a particle in the state |Psi> = a|0> + B|1>

* Both Alice and Bob receive one of a pair of entangle particles, both of which exist in the Bell state |B_00> = 1/sqrt2 * (|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>

* Alice passes her particles through a CNOT gate, |Psi_a> = W_CNOT(|Psi>|B_A>) (where |B_A> is Alice's part of the entangled pair)

* Alice then passes her |Psi> particle through a Hadamard gate.

* The final state of the composite system is then a superposition with equal probability of Alice measuring her pair of particles in any combination, and Bob's particle is a superposition matching Alice's |Psi> particle.

(Side note, this would be much clearer if the subreddit supported LaTeX.)

What I don't understand is how passing Alice's part of the entangled Bell pair can change Alice's particle but not Bob's particle. Isn't the CNOT gate interacting with (i.e. measuring) Alice's particle, and therefore collapsing Bob's particle? Specifically (ignoring constants),

|Psi_sys> = |Psi>|B_00>

|Psi_sys> = (|0> + |1>)(|0_A>|0_B> + |1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = |0>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |1>(|0_A>|0_B>) + |0>(|1_A>|1_B>) + |1>(|1_A>|1_B>)

|Psi_sys> = (|0>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|1>|0_A>)|0_B> + (|0>|1_A>)|1_B> + (|1>|1_A>)|1_B>

This last step feels like abuse of notation, considering the entangled nature of the Bell state. Can someone clarify what is happening here?"

And can spectroscopy actually span the entire EM spectrum?

It seems the amount of information that can be garnered from a spectroscopic analysis is mind boggling."
