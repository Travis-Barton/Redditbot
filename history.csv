Hi, so with the recent photo of the black hole it got me thinking. If we can take a photo of a black hole that is a million light years away, why cant we take photos of planet surfaces? I looked up how planets can sustain life, and I was told that up to 40 million planets CAN inhabit life. And that 11 million of them are very closely related to Earth. If our satallites can take photos of our planet, can we take photos of other ""earth-like"" planets? Maybe to see if there are other lifeforms? 

Basically what I'm saying is, why dont we check for lifeforms by taking photos of planets closest to ours?"

The “good” makeup remover I’m comparing the “bad” one to has the number 23559 listed as the last ingredient with no chemical name before it, so I’m confused.  There’s a comma before it so it’s not associated with the previous ingredient (which is “Red 40 (CI 16035)” if that matters).  I’ve tried googling stuff but I came up short so I figured I’d ask you guys.  Thanks in advance!

While theres obviously plenty of protein in any meat, the label always says '0g carbohydrates'.

I have also read, that red meat contains the sugar Neu5Gc (that ones a topic for another day).

&#x200B;

So my question(s) would be: 

Are trace amounts of sugars (too little for the label) enough to facilitate the Maillard reaction?

Does the label not have to list ""special"" carbohydrates other than the more well knowns, like sucrose, fructose etc etc.?"

3189,bhz9i4,"If light is produced by the release of photons when electrons return to stable energy levels, why do blackbody objects emit light over a continuous and wide spectrum?",physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-27,"Doing some light reading on the Internet and was reading up on black body objects and why objects glow when they heat. I was told that photons are released through the excitement of electrons, and then you have things with emission spectrums and so on. This implies that the spectrum should only have very specific wavelengths of light. However, I have looked at spectrum graphs of objects such as incandescent lightbulbs and found that they emit light over a continuous spectrum of various intensities that extend over a significant range of wavelengths. 

Why is this so? Why are the emission spectrum wavelengths not emitted? What is it in the function of blackbody objects that make them emit light across a constant stream of wavelengths?"

3206,bi8oum,"If the expansion of the universe is accelerating, doesn't that disprove a fundamental assumption in Big Bang theory?",physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-28,"As far as i understand it, big bang theory came about to explain the expansion of the universe: We can observe that everything is moving away from eachother, so if you measure the speed, and then run it backwards  (under the assumption that the speed of expansion is constant), you reach a ""beginning of time"" when the universe was a singularity.

So when that 1998 study proved that the universe isn't only expanding, it's accellerating, ie the ***speed is changing(!)***, wouldn't that disprove one of the core assumptions of Big Bang theory?

In other words: If we know that the speed of expansion is different at different times in the history of the universe, how can we say it must have been going on constantly since a singularity?

If the expansion seems to be due to an unknown force rather than an initial ""bang"", doesn't that advice AGAINST the big bang theory? Especially since the speed seems to be slower the further back in time we're able to look. Like, maybe the universe just gets a bit bigger or smaller in different places and at different times? (since the visible universe is most likely a very small part of the *whole* universe)

Am i wrong somewhere in my reasoning? Astrophysicists please exlplain."
3207,bi8o7l,[Physics] Could a time dilation gradient occur on the scale of a human?,physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-28,"Time dilation caused by gravity is either almost unmeasurable (like on earth) or spread out over such a large space that locally no change would be observed (like near a black hole).

Basically my question is what would happen if there was a time dilation gradient over a distance of only a few feet or even inches, and is that even possible?

3208,bidx8j,"How do different anti particles interact? This post is going to have a bunch of different questions, so sorry for the confusion",physics,physics,1.0,2019-04-28,"
1) is it possible for there to be, somewhere in the universe, planets made of antiparticles? I know that theoretically half matter half antimatter was created, but since our solar system exists, could there are ossicle be an “inverse” with antimatter?

2) I recently read an article about neutrinos which said  that neutrinos might be their own anti particles. If (hypothetically) that was the case, could you create energy by only making neutrinos and making them collide?

3) what are the “unwanted emissions” when matter and anti matter collide ( the equivalent of radiation for nuclear fusion, CO2 for fossil fuels, etc...)? 

4) I saw a video about strange quarks and strange matter and how( in theory) everything it  comes in contact with also turns to strange matter. How does that process work?

I am from a country in the northern temperate zone, currently in the middle of the Spring. A couple days ago I went for a jog in the woods. The snow has melted away just about everywhere, except in the woods because of the shade from the trees. There were still big patches of snow and ice, both on the path and off it. About 70% ground and 30% snow. 

I noticed that as I ran, the temperature changed a lot. Suddenly I felt that I sort of entered a hot “pocket” of air, about 20 meters later i was out of it. Not long after I felt the air get cold, almost as if i ran into a freezer. These “pockets” were really weird, and it felt as if I stepped in and out of a building when I walked through, there were a lot of them, and I could not make out any pattern or relation to the snow-patches. Warm air sometimes appeared above snow, and cold air could be above ground. There were not any wind, so I don’t think that affected it.

Does anyone have any idea/suggestion about what causes these?"
